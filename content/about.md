On 4/27 the founder of Polygon, Sandeep Nailwal, stated that all community members in the Polygon ecosystem were to be dubbed "Goons" and declared that the symbol for the Goons was the ðŸ‘¿ emoji.

The GOON token represents the Polygon ecosystem and the mascot of its dedicated community, vibrant energy, and robust ecosystem.

We are all GOONs ðŸ‘¿ on Polygon.
